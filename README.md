# Embedded ML
Embedded ML aims to be a static-typed scripting language that gets performance and type safety of a static-typed language, while still remains most of the convenience of a dynamic-typed language. This project is in a very early stage, so I will make breaking changes frequently.

## Quick Start
See how to build the project [here](docs/build.md).
